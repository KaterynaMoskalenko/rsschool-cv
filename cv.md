#### Instance from codewars:
function should return a number (final grade). There are four types of final grades:
* 100, if a grade for the exam is more than 90 or if a number of completed projects more than 10.
* 90, if a grade for the exam is more than 75 and if a number of completed projects is minimum 5.
* 75, if a grade for the exam is more than 50 and if a number of completed projects is minimum 2.
* 0, in other cases:
```
function finalGrade(exam, projects) {
  if (exam > 90 || projects >= 10) {
    return 100;
  } else if (exam > 75 && projects >= 5) {
    return 90;
  } else if (exam > 50 && projects >= 2) {
    return 75;
  } else {
    return 0;
  }
}
```
